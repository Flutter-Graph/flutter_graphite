The only reason why the latest release of Graphite become possible is because of __Armed Forces Of Ukraine__.
Ukrainian defenders are those who saved the author's life last spring and currently continue fighting 
with absolute evil in my country. If you liked this lib and want to support future releases I would 
be grateful for your donations to [Come Back Alive](https://savelife.in.ua/en/donate-en/#donate-army-card-once) Charity which directly supports UA Army with equipment. 

Thank you.
